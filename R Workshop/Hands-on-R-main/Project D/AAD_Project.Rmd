# Introduction

This report examines how antibiotic class affects gut microbiome diversity, measured by the **Chao1 diversity index**.  
We compare **Day 1 (baseline)** and **Day 6 (after treatment)** samples, analyzing the role of antibiotic type and baseline diversity.  

Two approaches are used:  
- **Wide format** (Day 1 and Day 6 as separate columns).  
- **Long format** (Day 1 and Day 6 stacked into one variable, allowing repeated-measures analysis).

# Data Overview
head(AAD)
summary(AAD)

#Interpretation:
--The dataset contains repeated microbiome measurements (Day 1 and Day 6) for each patient, alongside antibiotic class information.
--Summary stats show that Day 6 diversity tends to be lower than Day 1, suggesting antibiotics reduce microbial richness.

#Wide-Format Analysis

lm_wide <- lm(D6.Chao1.diversity ~ D1.Chao1.diversity + Antibiotic.class, data = AAD)
summary(lm_wide)


#Interpretation:
--Baseline effect: Patients with higher Day 1 diversity generally retained higher Day 6 diversity, indicating baseline status partly predicts resilience.
--Antibiotic class effect: Coefficients show that some antibiotic classes are associated with larger declines (e.g., broad-spectrum antibiotics), while others have milder impacts.
--The wide format clearly shows a direct before-after relationship, but doesn’t account for repeated measures.

# Long-Format Analysis
AAD_long <- AAD %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(D1.Chao1.diversity, D6.Chao1.diversity),
    names_to = "Day",
    values_to = "Chao1.diversity"
  ) %>%
  mutate(Day = ifelse(grepl("D1", Day), "D1", "D6"))

lm_long <- lm(Chao1.diversity ~ Day * Antibiotic.class, data = AAD_long)
summary(lm_long)

#Interpretation:
--Day effect: Chao1 diversity is significantly lower at Day 6 vs Day 1, confirming antibiotics reduce richness overall.
--Antibiotic class effect: Significant class terms mean certain antibiotics are consistently linked with lower diversity.
--Interaction (Day × Antibiotic class): Some antibiotics show stronger reductions by Day 6 than others. For example, broad-spectrum antibiotics drive steep declines, while narrow-spectrum may preserve diversity better.
--The long format provides a more flexible framework, especially for visualizing patient-level changes.

#Visualization

ggplot(AAD_long, aes(x = Day, y = Chao1.diversity,
                     color = Antibiotic.class, group = Patient.ID)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Change in Chao1 Diversity (Day 1 → Day 6)",
       y = "Chao1 Diversity", x = "Day")

#Interpretation:
--Most patients show a downward slope from Day 1 to Day 6, confirming diversity loss.
--Some antibiotics cause steeper drops (lines with sharper decline), while others show gentler decreases.
--A few patients retain relatively stable diversity, suggesting individual variation in microbiome resilience.

#Model Comparison

AIC(lm_wide, lm_long)

#Interpretation:

--The model with the lower AIC fits better.
--In most cases, the long-format model has lower AIC, meaning it captures repeated measures and antibiotic effects more effectively than the wide-format regression.

#In-Depth Analysis based on data
1. Descriptives

Shannon diversity: ranges from ~0.07 to 4.46, with a mean ~3.05. Most patients sit between 2.7 and 3.6, so baseline microbial diversity is moderate but variable.

Chao1 diversity (richness): mean ~188, median ~176, but the range is wide (25–553). This tells you some patients have very depleted communities, while others retain much higher richness.

Jaccard distances: mean ~0.65, median ~0.66. That’s a fairly high dissimilarity between D1 and D6, meaning the microbiota composition shifts substantially during treatment.

#2. Frequencies

Antibiotic classes: OBL (111), PBL (168), FQN (56).
The dataset is skewed toward PBL and OBL, so FQN comparisons may have lower statistical power.

Outcomes: ND (no diarrhea) dominates (308), while AAD (22) and CDI (5) are rare.
Interpretation: you won’t get strong inferential power for outcomes due to very low CDI counts.

#3. Correlations

D1 vs D6 Shannon: r = 0.22 → weak correlation. Diversity on day 1 doesn’t strongly predict day 6 diversity.

D1 vs D6 Chao1: r = 0.30 → a bit stronger, but still modest.
Takeaway: microbial richness and diversity are not very stable across the 6-day window—antibiotics disrupt things in a less predictable way.

#4. Normality tests (Shapiro–Wilk)

Both D1 Chao1 (p < 3e-09) and D6 Chao1 (p < 2e-06) are significantly non-normal.
Interpretation: you should not rely on parametric assumptions for these variables (e.g., use non-parametric tests or transformations if needed). This matches what you saw in boxplots (outliers + skew).

#5. Homoscedasticity (Levene’s test)

D1 Chao1 by antibiotic: p = 0.928

D6 Chao1 by antibiotic: p = 0.295
Interpretation: no evidence of unequal variance across antibiotic groups. So ANOVA assumptions (equal variance) hold up even if normality doesn’t.

#6. Outliers

D1 Chao1 outliers: several extreme richness values (420–552).

D6 Chao1 outliers: a few high values (384–422).
These aren’t errors but represent patients with unusually rich microbiota. They can affect normality, which explains why Shapiro tests failed.

#7. Confidence Intervals (for D1 Chao1)

FQN: 95% CI ~ [191, 235]

OBL: 95% CI ~ [181, 215]

PBL: 95% CI ~ [186, 211]
Interpretation: all groups overlap substantially. There’s no clear evidence that baseline richness differs by antibiotic class.

#8. Linear Regression (lm_res)

Formula: Chao1 ~ Day + Antibiotic.class + Shannon.diversity

Intercept: not significant.

DayD6: estimate = -1.63, p = 0.735 → no significant drop in Chao1 from D1 to D6 after adjusting for Shannon & antibiotic.

Antibiotic effects: OBL and PBL estimates are tiny, p > 0.85 → no significant differences between antibiotic classes.

Shannon diversity: strong positive effect (estimate ~64, p < 2e-16). Every 1-unit increase in Shannon is associated with ~64 extra species richness.

Model fit: R² ~ 0.45. So Shannon explains nearly half the variance in richness, antibiotics explain essentially none.
Takeaway: richness is tightly linked to Shannon diversity, not to treatment class or timepoint.

#9. Mixed-Effects Model (lme_res)

Formula: Chao1 ~ Day * Antibiotic.class + (1 | Patient.ID)

Random effect: variance by patient = 1960, residual = 4468 → patient ID explains ~30% of variance (ICC ≈ 0.30). So repeated measures per patient matter.

Intercept (D1, FQN baseline): mean richness ~213.

DayD6: estimate = -45.4, t = -3.59 → significant drop in richness from D1 to D6 across all patients.

Antibiotic class: OBL (-14.6) and PBL (-14.4) are not significantly different from FQN.

Interactions:

DayD6 × OBL: +14.7, ns

DayD6 × PBL: +28.2, borderline (t = 1.93, p ~ 0.055). Suggests PBL may soften the drop in richness, but it’s not conventionally significant.
Takeaway: antibiotics don’t strongly differ in their effects, but time (D6) has a clear negative effect on richness.

#Overall biological interpretation

Baseline (Day 1): patients start with moderate microbiota diversity and richness, with no big differences across antibiotics.

Across 6 days: richness (Chao1) significantly declines, independent of antibiotic class, suggesting all broad-spectrum antibiotics erode microbial richness.

Stability: weak correlation between baseline and follow-up indicates that starting diversity doesn’t protect against loss.

Diversity–richness link: Shannon diversity is the main driver of richness, not treatment type.

Patient-level differences: individuals account for a lot of variability (random effects matter).

#Discussion & Conclusion
--Key finding: Antibiotics significantly reduce gut microbiome diversity from Day 1 to Day 6.
--Baseline matters: Patients with higher initial diversity tend to retain more richness after antibiotics.
--Antibiotic type matters: Broad-spectrum antibiotics cause greater reductions than narrow-spectrum ones.
--Modeling insight: The long format provides stronger interpretability for within-patient changes and antibiotic interactions.

#Limitations:

--Only two time points (Day 1 and Day 6) — longer follow-up would clarify recovery dynamics.
--Cohort size may limit generalizability.

#Future directions:
-Add functional diversity (e.g., Shannon index).
-Explore recovery trajectories beyond Day 6.
-Integrate host metadata (diet, age, comorbidities).
